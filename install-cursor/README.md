# Install Cursor (Cross-Platform Installer)

Easily download and install any version of [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) on **macOS**, **Linux**, or **Windows** from the command line.  
This script is part of the [big-bear-scripts](https://github.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts) collection.

---

## Features

- **Interactive version picker** ‚Äì choose any available Cursor version, or install the latest by default.
- **Cross-platform** ‚Äì supports macOS (Intel & Apple Silicon), Linux (x86_64 & ARM64), and Windows.
- **Security checks** ‚Äì verifies download sources and (on macOS) checks app signature and notarization.
- **Automatic installation** ‚Äì handles mounting, copying, and permissions for you.
- **Safe cleanup** ‚Äì removes temporary files after installation.

---

## Quick Start

Run the installer directly from your terminal:

```bash
bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts/master/install-cursor/run.sh)"
```

Or, using `curl`:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigbeartechworld/big-bear-scripts/master/install-cursor/run.sh)"
```

---

## Prerequisites

- **curl** (for downloading files)
- **jq** (for parsing JSON)
- **wget** (optional, for the quick start command)
- **macOS only:**
  - `hdiutil`, `codesign`, `spctl`, and `sudo` (for DMG mounting, signature, and notarization checks)

---

## How It Works

1. **Fetches** the latest Cursor version list from the official source.
2. **Prompts** you to pick a version (or defaults to the latest).
3. **Detects** your platform and downloads the correct binary.
4. **Verifies** the download source for safety.
5. **Installs** Cursor:
   - **macOS:** Mounts DMG, verifies signature, installs to `/Applications`.
   - **Linux:** Saves AppImage to `~/Applications/`.
   - **Windows:** Saves installer to `~/Downloads/` (run manually).
6. **Cleans up** all temporary files.

- **macOS:** App signature and notarization are checked for extra safety.
- **Linux/Windows:** No signature check; always verify the source if you have concerns.
